# BMCGlossaries
The cant (or slang) glossaries after the text of multiple editions of the “memoirs” of Bampfylde-Moore Carew change over time and with each edition. This dataset tracks the changes in the ways words were entered in the glossaries over time and highlights a few of the important characteristics of the data. The works are now in the public domain and so the dataset is made openly available for reuse, augmentation, and recreation by scholars and logophiles.
